          <h3>Joining a Game</h3>
          <p>
            As Due Process is an alpha game, the population of players is low. This can mean that it is difficult to form games sometimes, especially during non-peak hours. The key is to be patient. <br><br>

            If there are players online, you should click the "Play" button in the main matchmaking menu in order to get into a game. First, the game will check if there are any active games that you can get put into. Next, the game will check if there are any other squads that are also matchmaking that you can be merged into. Once you are in a squad, the game will begin to search for an opponent. Once an opponent is selected, the game will choose a region based on the choice of the players. After selecting a region, a server will spin up for your match. Soon you will be connected to your game, and dropped into the pre-game firing range.
          </p>

      <!-- first steps section -->

          <h3>First Steps</h3>
          <p>
            Players are in the firing for about two minutes before the match begins. Once the match begins, attackers are moved into the attacker truck, and defenders are moved into their defender area. You will start by seeing the map screen, which can be toggled with TAB or M. Plans can be drawn on this map using left click, and erased with right click. They will only be visible to your team, and the spectators. You can click and drag your player puck to either indicate your intention as an attacker, or choose your spawnpoint as a defender.<br><br>

            Red doors and objects can only be entered with the usage of explosives, such as the Door Charge, or more rarely the Wall Charge. Green doors can be entered by kicking them or shooting the lock with a shotgun. Typically, there are two red entrances, and one green entrance on each map. Wall charges can only be used on internal walls -- attackers cannot blast through exterior walls, except for shutters or dock bay doors. Windows, marked in blue, can be shot through or have grenades thrown through them.<br><br>

            After a plan has been decided on through communication with your team via map drawing and voice chat, make sure to close your map and grab gear off of the wall. Weapons, ammo, and gadgetry can be picked up by looking at it and pressing E. As a defender, you must pick up a secondary weapon in order to spawn in the world after the planning phase.<br><br>

            Next, it's fighting time! If you're on attack, try to infiltrate the building and defuse the bomb. If you're on defense, try to prevent the attackers from doing so! Use the gear you have to accomplish your goal. First team to take 5 rounds wins; teams swap sides each 3 rounds.
